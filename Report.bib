    abstract =    "We present a refined chosen-prefix collision
        construction for MD5 that allowed creation of a rogue
        Certification Authority (CA) certificate, based on a
        collision with a regular end-user website certificate
        provided by a commercial CA. Compared to the previous
        construction from Eurocrypt 2007, this paper describes
        a more flexible family of differential paths and a new
        variable birthdaying search space. Combined with a
        time-memory trade-off, these improvements lead to just
        three pairs of near-collision blocks to generate the
        collision, enabling construction of RSA moduli that are
        sufficiently short to be accepted by current CAs. The
        entire construction is fast enough to allow for
        adequate prediction of certificate serial number and
        validity period: it can be made to require about
        2$^{49}$ MD5 compression function calls. Finally, we
        improve the complexity of identical-prefix collisions
        for MD5 to about 2 $^{16}$ MD5 compression function
        calls and use it to derive a practical single-block
        chosen-prefix collision construction of which an
        example is given. {\copyright} 2009 Springer.",
